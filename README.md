# Dublin Creche Reviews
Dublin Creche Reviews is a React Application that allows people to find or post reviews and information about a creche or a Montessori school in Dublin Ireland.

Finding a spot in a school in Dublin can be difficult, and since the Covid-19 crisis started this has only become more difficult because viewings can not take place anymore.
It is quite common for parents to exchange opinions about schools and to do that they have been using social media.

Dublin Creche Reviews is an app dedicated to helping parents form an opinion about a school based on real experiences that other people have had there.
